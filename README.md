# euler-javascript

## Installation and running
Make sure you have git, node, time installed

```
git clone https://github.com/zpenka/euler-javascript.git
cd euler-javascript
time node N.js
```
Here, N is any of the solutions I have committed (ie 1, 2, 5, etc)

## General procedure
1. Get it working, however slow
2. Look up an algorithm/fast way to do it mathematically
3. Turn it into JS
4. Tweak it to get it running as fast as possible
